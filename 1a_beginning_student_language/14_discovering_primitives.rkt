; Two general techniques you can use for discovering primitives.
; (1) Make a lucky guess.
; (2) Search (look up) and scroll.

; So that's two ways you can discover new primitives. You can either guess -- and
; you'd be surprised how often you get lucky -- or you can look up the documentation
; for an existing primitive and scroll around to find related primitives.

; As you program more and more, you'll get to know more and more primitives, and
; you'll be able to guess lucky more often.

; You're also going to see that programming environments -- that's editors like
; DrRacket -- have tools that help you guess more quickly. And we'll look at some of
; those in later weeks of the course.
